# Crisis Containment Service (CriC)
The project is about designing a Web Platform that allows the handling of several emergency situations, like earthquakes, fires, floods, etc by users. The core of the project consists in the map, which is basically Google Maps API, that supports multiple layers of events.

Any logged user can add events, and they can be “judged” by other users with the implementation of a score system, where the most trustworthy users are rewarded accordingly with stars, that show the level of trust he is given by the score system.

Also, if a specific person is in danger, he can show others his location, and a marker is added to the map. If you are looking for someone, he must be a registered user, and if he is in the database you will receive his/hers last know coordinates. It is possible for a user to add information about another user, with location and description if it is needed for those wanting to help.

Our website integrates a notification system that notifies the users that are in emergency situation radius that they are in danger, and they can mark if they’re safe or not.
